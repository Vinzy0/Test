Hey there, i have no clue what im doing or what a README.md is so please bear with me ðŸ˜­
if everything goes smoothly. this project should be about making a random quote generator.

you push a button. you get a new quote.

thats really it. 

UPDATE: i give up ðŸ’€, i made a different quote generator on python.

ill probably not learn javascript for now and then regret it in the future :p
